# Product Guidelines - $4 Portfolio

## Content Tone and Voice
- **Professional and Concise:** All descriptions should be technically accurate and brief. Avoid fluff and focus on the technical substance of the work.
- **Audience-Aware:** Write with the engineering recruiter or technical collaborator in mind, using industry-standard terminology.

## Structural Consistency
- **Multi-Page Organization:** Maintain a clear separation between the bio (homepage), projects, slides, and contributions.
- **Impact-First Descriptions:** Every project or contribution description must start with a clear statement of its purpose or the problem it solves.
- **Link Integrity:** Ensure all external links to profiles, repositories, and slides are functional and use descriptive anchor text.
- **Categorization:** Maintain the existing organization of projects by programming language and contributions by ecosystem (e.g., Linux, GNOME).

## Visual Identity
- **Minimalist Aesthetic:** Adhere to the `jekyll-theme-minimal` style. The layout should remain uncluttered to keep the focus on the content.
- **Markdown Purity:** Use standard Markdown for all formatting to ensure maximum compatibility and ease of maintenance.
