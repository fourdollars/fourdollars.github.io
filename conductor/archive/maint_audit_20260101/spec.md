# Track Spec: Project Maintenance & Enhancement

## Overview
This track focuses on the maintenance and baseline enhancement of the portfolio project. The goal is to ensure all existing links are functional, descriptions are consistent with the new product guidelines, and the build pipeline is verified.

## Objectives
- Audit all external links in `README.md`.
- Refactor project descriptions in `README.md` to be "Impact-First" and technically concise.
- Verify the local Jekyll build and deployment workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No broken links in `README.md`.
- All side projects follow the "Impact-First" description style.
- Jekyll site builds successfully without errors.
